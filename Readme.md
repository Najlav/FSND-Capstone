# Full Stack Capstone Project

The Restruant API supports a basic Restruant by allowing users to query the database to preview the Menu or to book a table. There are 3 different user roles (and related permissions), which are:

Public user: Can view the menu and book a table.
Reservation manager: Can view a all reservations details.
Menu manager: Can add or delete dishes from the Menu.


## Running the API 
API endpoints can be accessed via https://restaurant-fsnd-capstone.herokuapp.com/

Auth0 information for endpoints that require authentication can be found in setup.sh.


## Installing Dependencies 

1. **Python 3.7** - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the [python docs](https://docs.python.org/3/using/unix.html#getting-and-installing-the-latest-version-of-python)


2. **Virtual Enviornment** - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)


3. **PIP Dependencies** - Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


4. **Key Dependencies**
 - [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/)  is a lightweight backend microservices framework. Flask is required to handle requests and responses.

 - [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is the Python SQL toolkit and ORM we'll use handle the lightweight sqlite database. You'll primarily work in app.py and can reference models.py. 

 - [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#) is the extension we'll use to handle cross origin requests from our frontend server. 

## Testing
To run the tests, run the postman collectection file in postman [Restraunt.postman_collection](https://)
